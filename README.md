# Rubber-Ducky-Troll-Payload
Funny/ interesting Rubby Ducker payload. If you don't know how to set up the RD check out a video from NetworkChuck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_f9p-_JWZw
This payload will: 1. open https://fakeupdate.net/win10ue/
                   2. Navigate to device manager
                   3. uninstall a keyboard
                   4. navigate back to edge (default browser for windows)
                   5. enter fullscreen
      
I wrote this for Win11 so please tell me if it works on Win10 aswell. 
I couldn't test this yet so lmk if it works. If not (this is my first project) just change something
